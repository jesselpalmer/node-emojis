### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript files
- `npm test` - Run all tests with coverage
- `npm run lint` - Run TypeScript, Markdown, and YAML linters
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues where possible
- `npm run clean` - Clean build outputs

### Testing

- We use Mocha and Chai for testing
- Tests are written in TypeScript
- Aim for high test coverage (currently at 85%+)
- Run tests before submitting PRs

### Code Style

- TypeScript is configured with strict mode
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and meaningful commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests where applicable

### Adding New Emojis

1. Update `src/data/emojis.json` with the emoji mapping
2. Update `src/data/metadata.json` with emoji metadata
3. Update `src/data/categories.json` if adding to a category
4. Add tests for the new emoji
5. Run `npm test` to ensure everything works

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks that run:

- Linting checks
- Test suite

Make sure these pass before committing.
